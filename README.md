This is the Bioinformatics lecture material for the course "Innovative Tumor Therapies" of the Master Oncology course.
The lecture covers basic R syntax ([1st R_lab_session]("https://github.com/anoyaro84/R_lab_session.Rmd")) and some analysis using public cell line gene expression data ([2nd R lab session]("https://github.com/anoyaro84/R_lab_session_2.Rmd")).

The lab sessions will be done based on Rstudio, which can be either installed to the local or using the binder (no installation necessary).
