This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Some materials (e.g. figures) are obtained from the following sources:
* [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
* [Learn by Example](https://www.learnbyexample.org/)

## R basics

In this part, we will cover the very basic of R programming.
Let's try simple arithmetic.

* division `/`
* multiple `*`
* addition `+`
* exponent `^`
* subtraction `-`

In the chuck below, let's put some arithmetic expression as if it is an calculator.

```{r}
5+5
```

Instead of having the outcome prited, one can also store them to varaibles.
One can choose variable names and assign certain value.
You can give assign an expression, which will first be evaluated and then the outcome value is assigned.

```{r}
x <- 10 # value assignment
x <- 5 + 5 # outcome of 5+5 will be stored.
x # printing the contents of x
```

In R (and perhaps in programming in general), variables have a certain type.
The type of variables include:

* Numeric
* Logical
* Character

Some operations are only allowed among the certain type of variables.
(For instance, arithmetic operations are only possible with numeric variables).

You can check the type with the function `class`.


```{r}
a <- 1 > 5
#a <- 5+5
#a <- 'asdf'

class(a)

```


Instead of assigning one value to each variable at a time, you can also create a structured variable where multiple values are assigned to one variable.
There are several options available, including:

* vector - all element should have the same type
* Matrix  - all element should have the same type
* data frame - flexible
* list - flexible

![Overview of data types](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/images/hopr_0306.png)

The element in the structured variable can be accessed by `[]`.
For 2-dimensional data, one can specify both row and column indices (e.g., `a[1,5]` to access element in 1st row and 5th column).
You can also retrieve entire column or row by simply omitting one of the indices (e.g., `a[1,]`).

```{r r}

a <- matrix(1,2,3,4)

print(a)
print(a[1,])
print(a[1,2])

```


Note that in case mixed type of values are given to vector or matrix, the values are automatically converted (coercion) to make them all equal in type.

```{r }
a <- c(1,2,3)
#a <- c(1,2,'3')
#a <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), ncol = 2, nrow=2)

a
class(a)
```

So how does R coerce data types? If a character string is present in an atomic vector, R will convert everything else in the vector to character strings. If a vector only contains logicals and numbers, R will convert the logicals to numbers; every TRUE becomes a 1, and every FALSE becomes a 0.

![Data conversion](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/images/hopr_0301.png)


In case of dataframe and list, you are more flexible in putting mixed data types.

```{r }
a <- data.frame(age = c(10,20,30), name = c("Tom", "Paul", "Peter"))
#a <- list(a=c(1,2,3), b=c('1','2','3'), c=c())
  
a
class(a)
```

In programming general, function is a key element to make your script reproducible.
For instance, so far we used the following functions: `class`, `matrix`, `c`, `data.frame` and `list`.

A function is defined by a set of script, input arguments, and output argument.

```{r }

# sum is the function name and a, b are the arguments.
sum <- function(a, b) { # the part surrounded by {} is the body
  return (a+b) # the function simply return a+b
}

sum(4,5)

```

In some cases, you want to repeat the same operation over and over.
To reduce the number of lines, and to make it easier to read, we can use for loop.

The chunk of code sorrunded by `for(var in iterable){}` are excuted while `var` iterates over the `iterable`.

![How for loop works](https://www.learnbyexample.org/wp-content/uploads/r/r-for-loop-syntax.png)

```{r }

a = c(1,2,3,4,5)

for (i in 1:5){
  print(a[i])
}

# is the same as
print(a[1])
print(a[2])
print(a[3])
print(a[4])
print(a[5])

```


Furthermore, you may want to perform some operation only when certain condition meets.
This is when you can use a condiationial statements using `if` and `else`:
![Flowchart of if statement](https://www.learnbyexample.org/wp-content/uploads/r/r-if-else-if-else-statement-syntax.png)


```{r}

a = 10
if (a > 5) {
  a <- a - 5 # when the first condition holds
} else if (a != 0) {
  a <- a * 2 # when first condition did not hold, but second holds
} else { 
  a <- 0 # when none of the above hold
}

print(a)

```


##  Exercise

Please write a function:
* takes a number i
* return the sum of 1,2,..,i.
* use for loop
* print error message if i is not a numeric variable (use `is.numeric` function)

```{r }

# please come up with your own solution

```
