This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## R basics

In this part, we will cover the very basic of R programming.
Let's try simple arithmetic.

* division `/`
* multiple `*`
* addition `+`
* exponent `^`
* subtraction `-`


```{r}
5+5
```

Assignment of variables.
You can give a value, or an expression as well.

```{r}
x <- 10 # value assignment
x <- 5 + 5 # outcome of 5+5 will be stored.
x # printing the contents of x
```


There can be multiple type of variable.

* Character
* Numeric
* Logical


```{r}
a <- 1 > 5
#a <- 5+5
#a <- 'asdf'

class(a)

```


Also, you can hold a structured data.

* vector - all element should have the same type
* Matrix  - all element should have the same type
* data frame - flexible
* list - flexible

```{r }
a <- c(1,2,3)
#a <- c(1,2,'3')
#a <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), ncol = 2, nrow=2)

a
class(a)
```


```{r }
a <- data.frame(age = c(10,20,30), name = c("Tom", "Paul", "Peter"))
#a <- list(a=c(1,2,3), b=c('1','2','3'), c=c())
  
a
class(a)
```

In programming general, function is a key element to make your script reproducible.
A function is defined by a set of script, input arguments, and output argument.

```{r }

# sum is the function name and a, b are the arguments.
sum <- function(a, b) { # the part surrounded by {} is the body
  return (a+b) # the function simply return a+b
}

sum(4,5)

```

Furthermore, you can reduce the number of lines by using for loop.

![How for loop works](https://cdn.datamentor.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/r-for-loop.jpg)

```{r }

for (i in 1:5){
  print(i)
}

# is the same as
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

```

And you can handle conditional statements.
![Flowchart of if statement](https://cdn.datamentor.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/r-if-else-statement.jpg)


```{r}

a = 10
if (a > 5) {
  a <- a - 5 # when the first condition holds
} else if (a != 0) {
  a <- a * 2 # when first condition did not hold, but second holds
} else { 
  a <- 0 # when none of the above hold
}

print(a)

```


##  Exercise

Please write a function:
* takes a number i
* return the sum of 1,2,..,i.
* use for loop
* print error message if i is not a numeric variable (use is.numeric)

```{r }

# please come up with your own solution

```
